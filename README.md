# Inventory
NDP8
This app will allow a store to keep track of its product. For that, I have created a SQLite table where the user can add new 
products and the content will be displayed on the screen.
I have used 4 EditText and 1 spinner for the supplier name which I selected from a given range of 3.
In addition, it also have a Contract Java class and a DbHelper java class.
Finally, the app has several log calls to test the insert/read methods.
